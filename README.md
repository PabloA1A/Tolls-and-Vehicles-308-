# Tolls and Vehicles (*308)

## Instructions:
You are required to develop a program that models a toll system. Toll stations have a name, city in which they are located and a numeric value representing the total value of toll collected.

Vehicles arriving at a toll station have a license plate. The toll collects different toll values depending on the type of vehicle. If it is a car, the toll value is $100. If it is a motorcycle, $50. If it is a truck, the toll value depends on the number of axles, $50 is charged for each axle.

The toll station is required to calculate the toll value of each arriving vehicle and the total tolls collected. Thus, upon completion, the system is required to print on screen a list of vehicles that arrived at the toll and the cumulative total.
